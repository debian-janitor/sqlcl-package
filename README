The Debian Package sqlcl-package
--------------------------------

In order to run Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line you'll need a working JRE.
The minimum JRE you should use is 1.8 (JRE8.0).

There are several ways to obtain a compatible JRE:

- install default-jre (java), making sure it depends, at least, on the minimum
  required JRE version
- install one of the required openjdk-8-jre or openjdk-9-jre (java)
- install the meta-package java-runtime, making sure that it installs, at
  least, the minimum required JRE version as dependency
- install one of the meta-packages java8-runtime or java9-runtime, making sure
  that it installs, at least, the minimum required JRE version as dependency
- download and run the installer for the version you wish to install from
  Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/>
- install java-package (contrib/misc) and generate a Debian package from the
  above installer

After installing a compatible JRE simply launch SQL Developer Command-Line by
invoking either "sqlcl" (the recommended way), "sqlcl.standalone" or
"sql.[upstream version]".  The JRE will be automatically detected and used as
long as properly installed.
