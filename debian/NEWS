sqlcl-package (0.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

    Due to a conflicting name with content of package "parallel" the upstream
    binary "sql" will be renamed. Multiple versions can coexist so
    "sql.[upstream version].standalone" will invoke a specific version of
    Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line, "sql.[upstram version]" will invoke
    either the standalone or bundled Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line version
    (in this order), while "sqlcl" (the recommended way) and
    "sqlcl.standalone" take advantage of Debian's alternatives system and,
    when left in auto mode, will always invoke the highest version installed.
