sqlcl-package (0.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release (Closes: #882113, #882115)
  * Due to a conflicting name with content of package "parallel" the upstream
    binary "sql" will be renamed. Multiple versions can coexist so
    "sql.[upstream version]" will invoke a specific version of Oracle SQL
    Developer Command-Line, while "sqlcl" (the recommended way) and
    "sql.standalone" take advantage of Debian's alternatives system and, when
    left in auto mode, will always invoke the highest version installed.
