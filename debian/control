Description: Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line Debian package builder
 This utility makes it possible to build a Debian package from Oracle SQL
 Developer Command-Line (SQLcl). The Oracle SQL Developer program is governed
 by the copyright holder (Oracle USA, Inc.), so you may be limited as to what
 you can do with the resulting package (i.e. no redistribution, etc). This
 utility will simply help you create the Debian package, it is your
 responsibility to use the resulting package accordingly with the OTN license,
 a copy of which is included in the created package, that you must agree on
 when downloading the source.
 .
 This utility will require you to download the architecture independent archive
 from <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sqlcl/overview>,
 identified as "Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line for All Platforms", to create
 the Debian package from.
 .
 Due to a conflicting name with content of package "parallel" the upstream
 binary "sql" will be renamed. Multiple versions can coexist so
 "sql.[upstream version]" will invoke a specific version of Oracle SQL
 Developer Command-Line, while "sqlcl" (the recommended way) and
 "sql.standalone" take advantage of Debian's alternatives system and, when left
 in auto mode, will always invoke the highest version installed.
